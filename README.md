# Front End LMS (Library Management System)
Here is a new method used for implementing Library Management System (front-end). It is done as a project for HCI. <br/>
Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript <br/>
I'm open to suggestion to improve the project in any way, and would love to collaborate with you. <br/>
Here are a few screenshots of the webpage <br/>
*NOTE: This is a responsive website.* <br/>
